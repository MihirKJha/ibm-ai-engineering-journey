# Language Modeling

> A practical engineering guide to **Language Modeling**, covering statistical language models, neural language models, sequence-to-sequence architectures, evaluation metrics, and their evolution into modern Large Language Models (LLMs).

---

# 1. Overview

A **Language Model (LM)** is an AI model that learns the probability of sequences of words and predicts the next word or token based on previous context.

Language Models are fundamental to Natural Language Processing (NLP) and power applications such as:

- Text Generation
- Machine Translation
- Auto-Completion
- Spell Checking
- Chatbots
- Question Answering
- Large Language Models (LLMs)

Modern LLMs such as GPT and Llama are highly advanced language models built upon the same fundamental objective:

> **Predict the next token given the previous context.**

---

# 2. Why Language Models?

Computers do not naturally understand language.

Language Models learn:

- Grammar
- Word Order
- Context
- Semantic Relationships
- Sentence Structure

This enables machines to generate coherent and meaningful text.

# 5. Statistical Language Models

Statistical Language Models estimate the probability of a sequence of words using observed frequencies.

General formula:

```
P(Word | Previous Words)
```

These models form the historical foundation of NLP.

---

# 6. N-Gram Language Models

An **N-Gram** is a sequence of **N consecutive words**.

Examples:

Sentence:

```
Deep Learning is amazing
```

---

### Unigram (1-Gram)

```
Deep

Learning

is

amazing
```

---

### Bigram (2-Gram)

```
Deep Learning

Learning is

is amazing
```

---

### Trigram (3-Gram)

```
Deep Learning is

Learning is amazing
```

---

### General N-Gram

```
N consecutive words
```

---

# 7. Advantages and Limitations of N-Grams

### Advantages

- Simple
- Fast
- Easy implementation
- Good baseline model

---

### Limitations

- Data sparsity
- Large memory requirements
- Cannot capture long-range dependencies
- Vocabulary explosion

These limitations motivated the development of Neural Language Models.

---

# 8. Feed Forward Neural Language Models

Neural Language Models replace manual probability tables with neural networks.

Pipeline:

```

Advantages:

# 9. Sequence Models

Language often depends on long-term context.

Sequence Models process words in order while preserving contextual information.

Examples:

- RNN
- LSTM
- GRU

Applications:

- Translation
- Speech Recognition
- Text Generation

---

# 10. Sequence-to-Sequence (Seq2Seq)

Seq2Seq models convert one sequence into another.

Examples:

- Machine Translation
- Text Summarization
- Dialogue Systems

Workflow:

```text
Input Sequence
      │
      ▼
Encoder
      │
      ▼
Context Vector
      │
      ▼
Decoder
      │
      ▼
Output Sequence
```

Example:

```
English

↓

Encoder

↓

Context

↓

Decoder

↓

```

Seq2Seq models laid the foundation for modern Transformer architectures.

---

# 11. Encoder-Decoder Architecture

## Encoder

Reads and compresses the input sequence into a context representation.

---

## Context Vector

Stores information about the input sentence.

---

## Decoder

Generates the output sequence one token at a time.

# 12. Language Model Training

Training follows the standard Deep Learning workflow.
